Description: With given inputs that includes number of points, design space, measure skewness, models and parameter value, this package calculates the objective value, optimal designs and plot the equivalence theory under A- and D-optimal criteria under the second-order Least squares estimator. This package is based on the paper "Properties of optimal regression designs under the second-order least squares estimator" by Chi-Kuang Yeh and Julie Zhou (2021) <doi:10.1007/s00362-018-01076-6>.
